				<h2>Artist Statement</h2>
				<p>I started QUAY.cncpts in 2015 to separate myself from my mass market (sometimes corporate) product design industry
					past. I wanted to take a year and create a solo body of work that fundamentally
					changed the perspective of a consumer driven product (in this case: apparel) by challenging
					the definitive category and end use.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<h3>MY APPROACH:</h3>
				<p>
					I began by creating fabric sculptures in muslin, an unattractive canvas material
					typically used in the industry to mock up new styles and be thrown away after.
					Purposely drawing focus to a futile process within the industry, I aimed to treat
					this disposable fabrication in opposition: as a specialty, affected in different
					ways to appear more expensive, valuable, and influential.</p>
					<p>
						To continue my experiment of how we identify objects, I developed a series of
					garments in clear vinyl. This fabric completely disrupted the styleâ€™s intended
					application, especially when mounted on canvas and serving as a multidimensional
					composition. Directly drawing on the relationship between objects,
					how they are presented, and how they are identified, I intend to give the
					observer the opportunity to define each piece on their own by drawing from
						their own experiences.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>MY MISSION:</h3>
					<p>I strive to expand perspective- specifically, the connection between objects
					and identity. While I have started with a small collection of apparel examples (a
					familiar product and overlooked resource), my goal and essentially the
					explanation of my work is to ultimately continue to challenge what identity is,
					why, and the assumption of definitive categories.</p>
